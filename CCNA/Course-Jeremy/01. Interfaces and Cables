RJ ==> Registered Jack (known Etherent Ports)
UTP cables ==> Unshielded twisted pairs cables

** UTP cables are TWISTED cuz this helps protecting them from EMI (ElectroMagnetic Interference)

* Full-Duplex means that both devices can send and receive data at the same time.

* strait through cables doesn't allow devices having the same Tx and Rx pins to transmit data.

* crossover cables allow devices having the same Tx and Rx pins to transmit data by crossing over their cables.

* ALL devices (except switches) transmit on pins 1 and 2 and receive on pins 3 and 6

* AUTO-MDIX makes sure that the nabeur can transmit and receive data on these pins.
